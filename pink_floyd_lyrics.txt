1.PINK FLOYD - HIGH HOPES (LYRICS)__line1
Beyond the horizon of the place we lived when we were young__line2
In a world of magnets and miracles__line3
Our thoughts strayed constantly and without boundary__line4
The ringing of the division bell had begun__line5
Along the Long Road and on down the Causeway__line6
Do they still meet there by the Cut__line7
There was a ragged band that followed in our footsteps__line8
Running before times took our dreams away__line9
Leaving the myriad small creatures trying to tie us to the ground__line10
To a life consumed by slow decay__line11
The grass was greener__line12
The light was brighter__line13
When friends surrounded__line14
The nights of wonder__line15
Looking beyond the embers of bridges glowing behind us__line16
To a glimpse of how green it was on the other side__line17
Steps taken forwards but sleepwalking back again__line18
Dragged by the force of some inner tide__line19
At a higher altitude with flag unfurled__line20
We reached the dizzy heights of that dreamed of world__line21
Encumbered forever by desire and ambition__line22
There's a hunger still unsatisfied__line23
Our weary eyes still stray to the horizon__line24
Though down this road we've been so many times__line25
The grass was greener__line26
The light was brighter__line27
The taste was sweeter__line28
The nights of wonder__line29
With friends surrounded__line30
The dawn mist glowing__line31
The water flowing__line32
The endless river__line33
Forever and ever__line34

2.PINK FLOYD - TIME (LYRICS)__line36
Ticking away the moments that make up a dull day__line37
Fritter and waste the hours in an offhand way__line38
Kicking around on a piece of ground in your hometown__line39
Waiting for someone or something to show you the way__line40
Tired of lying in the sunshine, staying home to watch the rain__line41
You are young and life is long, and there is time to kill today__line42
And then one day you find ten years have got behind you__line43
No one told you when to run, you missed the starting gun__line44
And you run, and you run to catch up with the sun but it's sinking__line45
Racing around to come up behind you again__line46
The sun is the same in a relative way but you're older__line47
Shorter of breath and one day closer to death__line48
Every year is getting shorter, never seem to find the time__line49
Plans that either come to naught or half a page of scribbled lines__line50
Hanging on in quiet desperation is the English way__line51
The time is gone, the song is over, thought I'd something more to say__line52
Home, home again__line53
I like to be here when I can__line54
And when I come home cold and tired__line55
It's good to warm my bones beside the fire__line56
Far away across the field__line57
The tolling of the iron bell__line58
Calls the faithful to their knees__line59
To hear the softly spoken magic spells__line60

3.PINK FLOYD - SORROW (LYRICS)__line62
The sweet smell of a great sorrow lies over the land__line63
Plumes of smoke rise and merge into the leaden sky__line64
A man lies and dreams of green fields and rivers__line65
But awakes to a morning with no reason for waking__line66
He's haunted by the memory of a lost paradise__line67
In his youth or a dream, he can't be precise__line68
He's chained forever to a world that's departed__line69
It's not enough, it's not enough__line70
His blood has frozen and curdled with fright__line71
His knees have trembled and given way in the night__line72
His hand has weakened at the moment of truth__line73
His step has faltered__line74
One world, one soul__line75
Time pass, the river roll__line76
And he talks to the river of lost love and dedication__line77
And silent replies that swirl invitation__line78
Flow dark and troubled to an oily sea__line79
A grim intimation of what is to be__line80
There's an unceasing wind that blows through this night__line81
And there's dust in my eyes, that blinds my sight__line82
And silence that speaks so much louder than words__line83
Of promises broken__line84
